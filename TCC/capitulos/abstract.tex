Search to specific code has been very important from update to a more actual or efficient and with the projetc has every the least release of a language at this work Java.

Therefore the main goal of this project is develop a static analysis with objective to find specifics constructions of Java language, where this constructions can be older code or a update a block to another better such as foreach for a lambda expression. After find this code the place in source code is saved to write a output file for future evaluation and decide if this will be updated or not.

With focus in a flexibility the project the party responsible for visitors that find source code previously determined is the highest flexible that make easy in any time the developer create their own visitor and insert in the system without impacts in architecture. The output reports are flexible and automatics that provide in any time a possibility of chance the actuals ~\acs{CSV} files to another form such as database.
