Using programming language as research object is a challenging and complex task whether for mining information or to refactor, given the complex manipulation of a programming language. However there is a segment of software engineering that recommend deal with this kind of software as any other and this is called Grammarware.

From this segment, this final paper handles java language font code for detected outdated buildings. The main objective of this final paper is to make transparent the java language handling for it became a simple input like in any other software.

From this way the static analyzer provided from this final paper is capable from search any specific buildings from the Java language with may be easily defined by any developer regardless of any experience on handling programming language artifacts.

For the data extraction this work have as the main concern to uncouple the code analysis extradition so the mining data can be saved in any data structure from a simple CSV file up to any database.

%Search to specific code has been very important from update to a more actual or efficient and with the projetc has every the least release of a language at this work Java.

%Therefore the main goal of this project is develop a static analysis with objective to find specifics constructions of Java language, where this constructions can be older code or a update a block to another better such as foreach for a lambda expression. After find this code the place in source code is saved to write a output file for future evaluation and decide if this will be updated or not.

%With focus in a flexibility the project the party responsible for visitors that find source code previously determined is the highest flexible that make easy in any time the developer create their own visitor and insert in the system without impacts in architecture. The output reports are flexible and automatics that provide in any time a possibility of chance the actuals ~\acs{CSV} files to another form such as database.
