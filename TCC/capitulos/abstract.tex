Using programming language as research object is a challenging and complex task whether for mining information or to refactor, given the complex manipulation of a programming language. However there is a segment of software engineering that recommend deal with this kind of software as any other and this is called Grammarware.

From this segment, this final paper handles java language font code for detected outdated buildings. The main objective of this final paper is to make transparent the java language handling for it became a simple input like in any other software.

From this way the static analyzer provided from this final paper is capable from search any specific buildings from the Java language with may be easily defined by any developer regardless of any experience on handling programming language artifacts.

For the data extraction this work have as the main concern to uncouple the code analysis extradition so the mining data can be saved in any data structure from a simple CSV file up to any database.
