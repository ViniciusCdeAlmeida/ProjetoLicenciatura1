Use programming language like a research subject is a challenge and complex task either to mine information or to refactor, given the complexity of handling a programming language. However there is a segment of software engineering which recommends treating this model software like any other where this is called Grammarware.

From this segment, this final project handles source code of the Java language to detect outdated buildings. The main objective was to provide transparency in the handling of the Java language to make it a simple input as any other software. And easier to adopt this tool to check whether the language in which any software is being developed always uses current characteristics during development.

Thus the static analyzer that this work provided it is able to search for specific constructs of the Java language that can be easily determined by any independent developer of experience in handling the artifacts of a programming language.

For the extraction of data this work was with main concern to separate the extraction of code analysis and the mined data can be saved to any data structure that can be anything from a single file~\acs{CSV} accessible to a database.


%Search to specific code has been very important from update to a more actual or efficient and with the projetc has every the least release of a language at this work Java.

%Therefore the main goal of this project is develop a static analysis with objective to find specifics constructions of Java language, where this constructions can be older code or a update a block to another better such as foreach for a lambda expression. After find this code the place in source code is saved to write a output file for future evaluation and decide if this will be updated or not.

%With focus in a flexibility the project the party responsible for visitors that find source code previously determined is the highest flexible that make easy in any time the developer create their own visitor and insert in the system without impacts in architecture. The output reports are flexible and automatics that provide in any time a possibility of chance the actuals ~\acs{CSV} files to another form such as database.
